# AoC

This is just for fun and learning purpose.
The bigest ideas are to move out of comfort zone, learn and compare `golang` and `rust` programming languages

### Big Thanks to

- [Dmytro Shteflyuk](https://github.com/kpumuk) who explained me such challenges long long time ago. I really would like to see your solutions.
- [Mike Helmick](https://github.com/mikehelmick) who shares his solutions in `go`.
- [Christopher Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi) who explains everything about `rust` and show that it isn't always perfect.

It was a big challenge for me to do it daily. I haven't had enough knowledge about the problems and the libraries
which could help with them. There were four days where the second parts were too big for me. I still have to work on days 17, 22 and 24.
The work is `gonum` in day 23 paid of to solve the day 25 problem with it.

Some days were easy and I had time to do go and rust versions. It was great to watch Christopher's daily updates and learn rust.
Rust has a great community which looks similar to Ruby community. I miss that in GoLang world.

My 2011 macbook is still good enough to do it while day 23 run more than one hour to compute the second part. Christopher's 10 minutes was a good advice that
sometimes it's easier to wait. It isn't optimal but it works.
