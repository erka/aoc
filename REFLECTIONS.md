It was a big challenge for me to do it daily. I haven't had enough knowledge about the problems and the libraries
which could help with solving them. There were four days where the second part was too big for me. I still have to work on days 17, 22 and 24. The work with `gonum` in day 23 was paid of to solve the day 25 problem.

Some days were easy and I had time to do `go` and `rust` variants. It was great to watch Christopher's daily updates and learn `rust`.
`rust` has a great community which looks similar to `Ruby` community. I miss that in `go` world. And I feel like `rust` eats the pie of the `go` community.

My 2011 macbook is still good enough to do it while day 23 run more than one hour to compute the second part. Christopher's 10 minutes was a good advice that sometimes it's easier to wait. It isn't optimal but it works.

It was cool to see how people use `graphviz` to research the solution. It's easy to use and fun.
