This year I went with `go` only. Dmytro and Oleksiy did their solutions in `ruby`. I watched the `rust` implementation by Christopher for learning purposes. In first days I checked Mike's repo and was upset that he wasn't doing it. But he was able to join it later and I will study his solutions.
Thank you all for sharing your path in this adventure.

The hardest days for me were day 6, day 12, day 17, day 21 and day 24. I cheat on day 24 as I only found possible anomalies in code and used `gonum` and `graphviz` to find the solution. `xor` and `xor` are friends... I will look for general solution for that problem.

Anyhow, lots of learning this year. Special thanks to Dmytro for sharing his gems with me and the leaderboard. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

It was a big challenge for me to do it daily. I haven't had enough knowledge about the problems and the libraries
which could help with solving them. There were four days where the second part was too big for me. I still have to work on days 17, 22 and 24. The work with `gonum` in day 23 was paid of to solve the day 25 problem.

Some days were easy and I had time to do `go` and `rust` variants. It was great to watch Christopher's daily updates and learn `rust`.
`rust` has a great community which looks similar to `Ruby` community. I miss that in `go` world. And I feel like `rust` eats the pie of the `go` community.

My 2011 macbook is still good enough to do it while day 23 run more than one hour to compute the second part. Christopher's 10 minutes was a good advice that sometimes it's easier to wait. It isn't optimal but it works.

It was cool to see how people use `graphviz` to research the solution. It's easy to use and fun.
